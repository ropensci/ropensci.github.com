  abstract	= {Galileo wrote that "the book of nature is written in the
		  language of mathematics"; his quantitative approach to
		  understanding the natural world arguably marks the
		  beginning of modern science. Nearly 400 years later, the
		  fragmented teaching of science in our universities still
		  leaves biology outside the quantitative and mathematical
		  culture that has come to define the physical sciences and
		  engineering. This strikes us as particularly inopportune at
		  a time when opportunities for quantitative thinking about
		  biological systems are exploding. We propose that a way out
		  of this dilemma is a unified introductory science
		  curriculum that fully incorporates mathematics and
		  quantitative thinking.},

  abstract	= {Person-centered education is a counseling-originated,
		  educational psychology model, overripe for meta-analysis,
		  that posits that positive teacher-student relationships are
		  associated with optimal, holistic learning. It includes
		  clas- sical, humanistic education and today’s
		  constructivist learner-centered model. The author reviewed
		  about 1,000 articles to synthesize 119 studies from 1948 to
		  2004 with 1,450 findings and 355,325 students. The
		  meta-analysis design followed Mackay, Barkham, Rees, and
		  Stiles’s guidelines, including comprehensive search
		  mechanisms, accuracy and bias control, and primary study
		  validity assessment. Variables coded included 9 independent
		  and 18 dependent variables and 39 moderators. The results
		  showed that correla- tions had wide variation. Mean
		  correlations (r=.31) were above average com- pared with
		  other educational innovations for cognitive and especially
		  affective and behavioral outcomes. Methodological and
		  sample features accounted for some of the variability.},
