      <p>Scientist variability is high. I know it&#39;s risky to use statistical terms in non-statistical contexts on this blog, but it&#39;s a critical component of attitudes towards data sharing. This variability is manifested in many ways: what they study (ecologists, herpetologists, geneticists, microbiologists), how they study it (modelers, experimentalists, observationalists), their level of expertise (graduate students; postdocs; and BS, MS, and PhD-level researchers), and their professional affiliations (academic, government, non-governmental organization, museum).</p>

<p>Given this variability, it&#39;s not surprising that there exists diverse points of view about topics surrounding data. This is especially true for attitudes about data sharing. There are plenty of articles that tout the benefits of data sharing ((PARR and CUMMINGS, 2005, (Piwowar <em>et. al.</em> 2007), <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Too-Many-Researchers-Are/123749/?sid=at&amp;utm_source=at&amp;utm_medium=en" target="_blank">LeClere 2010</a>), but it is unclear whether these articles are being read by the &quot;scientist general public&quot; (i.e. NOT librarians, information scientists or data managers). In addition, attitudes about data sharing are strongly influenced by scientific field, the types of data collected, how hard it was to collect those data, and past experiences with sharing and collaboration (Tenopir <em>et. al.</em> 2011),</p>

<p>I am currently ruminating on the disparate attitudes towards data sharing and its causes, primarily because of the interactions I&#39;ve recently had with scientists for my current project. I am collecting information that will inform an Excel add-in designed to promote data sharing and archiving in science (learn more about the <a href="http://dcxl.cdlib.org">Digital Curation for Excel project (DCXL)</a>). To collect this information, I&#39;ve attended a few conferences and interviewed a lot of scientists. Part of this interview scheme is to ask them about their attitudes towards data sharing. Here I report on two groups of scientists with quite different perspectives.</p>

<p>In August, I attended the <a href="http://www.esa.org/austin/" target="_blank">Ecological Society of America Meeting</a> in Austin. Around 2,000 ecologists took over the city, and I managed to corner a few and badger them with questions. Here are my general observations about ecologists and data sharing:</p>

<ol>
<li>They know that they should share their data,</li>
<li>They think that it is very important to share data publicly, and</li>
<li>They did not list a litany of caveats to the two statements above.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sadly, although sharing data is important, it is not currently a priority for most ecologists. This is because of the time and effort involved in preparing data for others to use, as well as lack of knowledge about data centers and repositories they could utilize.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, I was in Seattle for the <a href="http://www.afs2011.org" target="_blank">American Fisheries Society Meeting</a>. About 4,500 fisheries scientists were in attendance, and I spoke with a good cross-section of them about data sharing. Here&#39;s my general observations for this group:</p>

<ol>
<li>They don&#39;t think they should have to share their data,</li>
<li>They think it is generally important for scientists to share their data, but are unwilling to share their own data, and</li>
<li>If they were to share their data, they would want to place a number of restrictions on its use and accessibility.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, not all of the ecologists or fisheries scientists are described by the statements above. These are, however, the general trends.</p>

<p>Although I could list some hypotheses about why these different points of view arise, I&#39;m more interested in their consequences. Are ecologists embracing meta-analysis and re-use of data more so than fisheries scientists? Are they collaborating more? Considering the current state of global fisheries (Tenopir <em>et. al.</em> 2011),(Worm <em>et. al.</em> 2009; Worm <em>et. al.</em> 2009), do the attitudes of fisheries scientists hinder our ability to model populations?</p>

<p>How should these attitudes and their consequences be addressed? In the case of ecologists, it seems simple enough: enable tools that make data sharing easy, foster good data management practices, and increase education about data centers and how they can be used. For fisheries scientists, there is the more challenging task of changing attitudes. Perhaps someone should conduct a fisheries-centered meta-analysis of the field&#39;s advancement due to open data practices, or we should focus on creating the ability to set a diversity of use policies for fisheries data placed in repositories.</p>

<p>Not all scientists think alike. We have different motivations, needs, and desires that influence our attitudes and decisions. This is the challenge for data centers, librarians, and funders: to find ways to address the needs for many different types of scientists and facilitate data sharing. Regardless of their differences, all fields of science benefit when data sharing is the norm and the progress of scientific discovery is accelerated through data re-use.</p>
